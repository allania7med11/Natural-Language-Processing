{"title":"Pantai Inn in La Jolla","txt":"This was another last minute trip to the coast to escape the heat and smoke here in Palm Springs. Only 2 hours from PS and we were in 76 degree weather and blue skies.\nThe Pantai is a charming Balinese inspired boutique hotel at the water's edge. The staff run by Ryan, the general manager could not have been more helpful or accommodating. Ryan is amazing. He's everywhere and handles everything a guest could request.\nWe've already reserved a room for next summer. That's how impressed we were"}
